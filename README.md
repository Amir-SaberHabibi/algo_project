# Bidirectional Dijkstra's Algorithm

- This is the implementation of Djiksra's algorithm, with a bidirectional approach to the problem. It simultaneously starts the searching process from the source and target nodes and stops when the two searches meet in the middle.
- The comparison between the normal approach and the bidirectional approach has been indicated in `dijkstra_comparison`.
