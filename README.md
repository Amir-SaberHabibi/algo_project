# Bidirectional Dijkstra's Algorithm

- This is the implementation of Dijksra's algorithm, with a bidirectional approach to the problem. It simultaneously starts the searching process from the source and target nodes and stops when the two searches meet in the middle, to find the shortest path from the source and the destination nodes.
- The runtime comparison between the standard and the bidirectional approaches has been indicated in `dijkstra_comparison`.
