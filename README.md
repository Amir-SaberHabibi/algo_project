# Bidirectional Dijkstra's Algorithm

- This is the implementation of Dijksra's algorithm, with a bidirectional approach to the problem. It simultaneously starts the searching process from the source and target nodes and stops when the two searches meet in the middle, in order to find the shortest path from the source node and the destination node.
- The comparison between the normal approach and the bidirectional approach has been indicated in `dijkstra_comparison`.
